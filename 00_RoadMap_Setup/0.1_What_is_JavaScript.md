# 0.1 – What is JavaScript?

## Definition
JavaScript (JS) is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **dynamic** programming language
used to make web pages **interactive and functional**.  
It runs **both in browsers and on servers (Node.js)**.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **High-level** → Handles low-level details automatically (like memory).  
- **Interpreted** → Runs line-by-line without compilation.  
- **Dynamically typed** → No need to define variable types explicitly.  
- **Prototype-based OOP** → Uses prototypes instead of classical classes.  
- **Event-driven** → Executes code in response to user or system events.

---

## Why JavaScript?
- The **only language that runs natively in all browsers**.  
- Used for both **Frontend (React, Vue)** and **Backend (Node.js, Express)**.  
- Powers **modern web apps**, **mobile apps (React Native)**, and **desktop apps (Electron)**.  
- Has a massive ecosystem and community (NPM).

## Where JavaScript Runs

| Environment | Example | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Browser** | Chrome, Firefox, Edge | Frontend (DOM, UI Interaction) |
| **Server** | Node.js | Backend (APIs, logic, databases) |

## JS vs Other Languages

| Feature | JavaScript | Python | Java |
|----------|-------------|--------|------|
| Typing | Dynamic | Dynamic | Static |
| Runs in Browser | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Runs on Server | ✅ (Node.js) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Compilation | Interpreted | Interpreted | Compiled |

## 🔧 How JavaScript Works
1. You write code in a `.js` file.  
2. Browser or Node.js interprets it.  
3. The **JS Engine** (like Chrome’s V8) converts it into machine code.  
4. Code executes line-by-line in a **single-threaded** environment.

## 🧰 Popular JS Engines

| Browser | JS Engine |
|----------|------------|
| Chrome / Node.js | **V8** |
| Firefox | **SpiderMonkey** |
| Safari | **JavaScriptCore** |

## 🧠 Real-World Example
When you click a **“Submit”** button on a website:  
1. JS validates the input (frontend).  
2. JS sends data to a backend API (Node.js).  
3. The server responds, and JS updates the UI instantly.  

That’s how **Full Stack JavaScript** works together.

 1. Write answers (in your own words):
   - What is JavaScript?  
   - Why do we need it?  
   - Where does it run?
