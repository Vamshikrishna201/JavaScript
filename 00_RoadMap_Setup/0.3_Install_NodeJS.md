# 0.3 – Install Node.js (Why We Need It)

## What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a **JavaScript runtime** that lets us run JavaScript **outside the browser**.  
It uses the **V8 engine** (same as Chrome) to execute JS code on your computer or server.

## Why Do We Need Node.js?

Normally, JavaScript runs in the **browser** and interacts with webpages.  
But for **backend tasks** like handling files, databases, or APIs, we need JS to run **outside the browser**.  

**Node.js allows us to:**
- Run JS in the terminal or command line  
- Build **backend servers** and **APIs**  
- Read/write files, connect to databases  
- Work on **full-stack projects** with the same language (JS)

## Step 1 – Download & Install Node.js

1. Go to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)  
2. Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version — it’s stable for learning and projects  
3. Run the installer and follow the steps  
   - Keep default settings  
   - Make sure **Add to PATH** is selected  
4. After installation, restart your terminal (or VS Code)

---

## Step 2 – Check Installation

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
node -v
```
You should see a version number like:
```bash
v20.2.0
```
This means Node.js is installed correctly.

You can also check npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm -v
```
It should show a number like:
```bash
9.8.0
```
### Step 3 – Run JS Using Node.js

1. Open VS Code or terminal
2. Create a file called hello.js
3. Write:
```bash 
    console.log("Hello from Node.js! 👋");
```

4. Run it in terminal:
```bash 
   node hello.js
```
You should see:
```bash
Hello from Node.js! 👋
```
This proves JS is running outside the browser.

### 🔧 Step 4 – Why Node.js vs Browser?

| Feature | Browser | Node.js |
| ------- | :-----:| :-----:  |
|Runs JavaScript | ✅   | ✅ |
|Access to DOM   | ✅   | ❌ | 
|Access to files | ❌   | ✅ | 
|Event-driven    | ✅   | ✅ | 

> Node.js allows you to use JS to do real backend work, not just interact with web pages.
